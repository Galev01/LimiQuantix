# PROJECT VISION: LIMIQUANTIX
**Goal:** Build a "VMware Killer" — a distributed virtualization platform that is modern, fast, and easy to use.

## The Market Opportunity
The Broadcom acquisition of VMware has created a **vacuum in the virtualization market**. The incumbents are:
- **Expensive**: Nutanix
- **Complex**: OpenStack
- **Limited**: Proxmox (lacks enterprise features)

**Our Sweet Spot:** The simplicity of Proxmox + the enterprise capabilities of vSphere.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Simplicity:** A user must be able to spin up a HA cluster in **under 10 minutes** (ideally 5).
2. **Performance:** The platform overhead must be **<1% of host resources**.
3. **Robustness:** The system assumes hardware *will* fail. It must **self-heal** (auto-restart VMs, re-balance storage).
4. **API-First:** Every feature must be an API call first. Terraform-native mindset.

## What We're Building
This is not just a "program" — this is a **Distributed Operating System** for virtualization.

### The Three Pillars:
1. **Compute Engine (Hypervisor)**: KVM + Cloud Hypervisor (Rust) for modern, secure VM execution
2. **Control Plane**: Distributed system (Go + Etcd) for cluster management, scheduling, and state
3. **Guest Agent**: Rust-based agent for deep VM integration, telemetry, and self-healing

## Competitive Differentiation
We win by being:

### 1. UX/UI First
- VMware is **clunky**
- Proxmox is **ugly**
- **We build beautiful**: Consumer-grade UI (think Vercel/Linear aesthetics)
- React + Tailwind + Framer Motion

### 2. API First
- VMware's automation is **painful**
- Every feature is an **API call first**
- Terraform Provider from Day 1

### 3. One-Click Clustering
- The hardest part of VMware/Proxmox is HA setup
- **Our Goal**: Plug in 3 servers → Run one command → Fully HA cluster in **5 minutes**

### 4. The "Magic" Agent
Our agent does things VMware's can't:
- **Self-healing**: Detect crashed services inside VMs and auto-restart
- **Real-time telemetry**: Actual RAM/disk usage (not just allocated)
- **Filesystem quiescing**: Database-safe snapshots
- **Works offline**: Uses virtio-serial, not network-dependent

## The Adversary
We are replacing **VMware vSphere**. We must be:
- ✅ **Cheaper** (open-source core, enterprise support model)
- ✅ **Faster** (Rust/Go, modern architecture, <1% overhead)
- ✅ **Better UI** (consumer-grade experience)
- ✅ **Easier** (5-minute HA cluster setup vs. days)

## Success Metrics
- **Time to HA Cluster**: < 10 minutes (target: 5 minutes)
- **Platform Overhead**: < 1% of host resources
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)**: < 60 seconds for VM failover
- **UI Performance**: < 100ms API response times, 60fps dashboard

## The Smart Play
We are **NOT** writing a hypervisor from scratch. That requires 100+ kernel engineers and 5+ years.

Instead, we follow **Google, AWS, and Nutanix**: Wrap standard Linux subsystems (KVM, Ceph, OVN) into a cohesive, beautiful, API-first platform.

**Innovation happens in**:
- The control plane (scheduling, orchestration)
- The agent (deep guest integration)
- The UX (making complexity invisible)
- The automation (one-click everything)
